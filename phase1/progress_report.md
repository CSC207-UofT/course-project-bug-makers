## Successful Designs
TODO:

## Use of GitHub Features
- Multiple issues were opened and resolved by pull requests to meet our `Phase1` goals, for example:
  - We established an auto-workflow, using `fix` statement to link the PR to the issue 
  - [`Issue #49`](https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-bug-makers/issues/49):
    - Conflicts arose within our dependencies under JDK16 environment, so we decided to downgrade it to JDK1.8
    - JDK successfully downgraded by merged pull requests: [`PR #50`](https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-bug-makers/pull/50), [`PR #51`](https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-bug-makers/pull/51)
  - We also labeled issues to keep our workspace organized.
  - [`Issue #45`](https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-bug-makers/issues/45) is labelled as enhancement
    - `userService` needs to support `reviewService`, so we decide to enhance their skeleton.
    - `userService` successfully supports operations on `review` entity groups with integrated database by merged pull requests: [`PR #47`](https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-bug-makers/pull/47)
- Over 20 merged Pull Requests were reviewed and approved by other team members for:
  - Implementation of functionality, 
  - Fixing bugs or typos, 
  - Refactoring existing Design Patterns
