## What is myCourseApp?

For our CSC207 project, we are planning to build a course planning app that allows students to plan and review their courses. A build-in connection to UofT API will present comprehensive course information to users, while user information is safely stored in a remote database. Along with an auto-scheduling algorithm that can help with course planning, a timetable visualization function gives a convenient course scheduling experience. Based on student reviews and user information, our app can also recommend specific courses tailored to the userâ€™s program requirements. Alongside the course planning function, our app aims to provide a platform for students to connect and network with their fellow peers.
