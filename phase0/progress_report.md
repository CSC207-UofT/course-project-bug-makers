## Specification Summary
For our CSC207 project, we are planning to build a course planning app that allows students to plan and review their courses. A build-in connection to UofT API will present comprehensive course information to users, while user information is safely stored in a remote database. Along with an auto-scheduling algorithm that can help with course planning, a timetable visualization function gives a convenient course scheduling experience. Based on student reviews and user information, our app can also recommend specific courses tailored to the userâ€™s program requirements. Alongside the course planning function, our app aims to provide a platform for students to connect and network with their fellow peers.

## CRC Model
- We established a clean structure with 3 controllers, 7 use cases and 3 entities with 1 CMD line driver for `Phase 0`.
  - 3 Controllers refer to our three main businesses, which are User Service, Calendar Service and Course Service.
    - User Service (`UserServiceController`): Responsible for user requests processing, e.g. register, login, retrieve user information.
    - Calendar Service (`CalendarPresenter`): Generate a timetable reflecting our current course schedule.
    - Course Service (`CourseServiceController`): Give course information. Help to schedule our course timetable.
  - 7 Use Cases are implemented to assist controllers.
    - User Service: `UserRequest`, with `UserDAO`, helps to interact Database to query/modify user data.
    - Calendar Service: `Calendar Factory` adopts the *Factory Design Pattern* to produce readable timetable representation.
    - Course Service: `CourseInformationGenerater`, with `CourseDAO`, helps to interact with UofT Art&Sci API to query the course information. `CoursePlanner` and `ScheduleUpdater` work together to provide auto-scheduling service based on course list.
  - 3 entities are implemented to organize information.
    - `User` will help to organize the user information, including course list and wish list. `Course` will help to organize the course information. `Schedule` will help to organize the schedule information. 
- We applied interface-oriented principle, where we segregate the dependencies by interfaces.
- Here is our software architecture diagram (for implemented part), showing the layer segregation:

- Here is our class dependency overview (for implemented part).

## Scenario Walk Through
![](progress_report.assets/myCourseApp.png)
- User will register/login an account, and then query course information. User can add their desired courses to course/wish list. After our algorithm generating a course schedule for the user, user can get a variety of timetables to help with user's time management. Note that, in the future, user will be able to access a forum to write reviews/rate courses.

## Skeleton Program & Successful Designs
![](progress_report.assets/CourseAppMindMap.png)
- We have `7.7k` lines implemented/optimized in our `Phase 0` project in total.
- [Kuan Pang & Michael Fang] We have successfully constructed a remote MongoDB to manage our user information, alongside password encryption and stale connection to the User Database.
- [Li Quan Soh & Sherry You] We have constructed a comprehensive CMD line interface, well adopting our backend services. We have provided over 20 commands for our users (Check `teamDocumentation` for details).
- [Kevin Cheng & Kuan Pang] We have connected our application with the UofT API for course information query, as well as a complete auto-scheduling algorithm (algorithm will be updated in `Phase 1/2`, preview is in our branch).
- [Jiaming Weng & Sherry You] We have adopted the *Factory Design Pattern* in our Calendar Service, where our structure supports a variety of timetable choices and customizations.
- We have followed clean structure and solid principle thorough out our `Phase 0` stage. Especially we have segregated the dependency by interfaces.
- All of our teammates have participated in the structure design and programming. Sherry You contributed a lot to our team documentations. 


## Open Questions
- After profiling our app performance, we found that the Database response is too time-consuming. We are looking for solutions to improve our Database response speed.
- We are looking for more efficient algorithm for course planning(scheduling).
- In case we want to build a forum in our app for course review, we may need extra support on data-synthesize.

## Next Steps
- Discuss the course review service's feasibility, as well as, the implementation of course recommendation system;
- Optimize our application's performance, e.g. DB response time;
- Implement more timetable choices, including Day timetable, Day to-do list, etc.;
- Provide more course information for users to help them with their course planning decisions;
- Implement GUI, and port our application to Android platform.
